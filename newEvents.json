    "title": "An Introduction to Mixed Methods for Social Scientists (Online)",
    "description": "<p>This course will be offered via Zoom only. However, this course will not be recorded.</p>\n<p>This is a 2-day (8/25 and 8/27) course, that runs from 10am &#8211; 4pm each day.</p>\n<p>Social scientists are often interested in untangling complex social issues, which require creative and expansive data and methods to address. Mixed methods research typically refers to research design and implementation that combines qualitative and quantitative data collection and/or analysis techniques. The goal of this two-day course is to introduce conceptual and practical frameworks and considerations in developing, designing, implementing, executing, analyzing, presenting, and writing up mixed methods research. We will focus on practical tools and challenges confronted across the stages of mixed methods research. This course is designed for those relatively new to mixed methods research, and interested in learning about it as a research approach and learning about considerations and principles in designing and executing it. Participants are encouraged to bring questions and queries about their own projects so we can discuss these as a group.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #84bd00\">Instructor: Shiri Noy</span></h3>\n<p>Shiri Noy is Assistant Professor of Sociology at Denison University. She has taught both graduate and undergraduate research methods, and has conducted and published interdisciplinary and sociological research across methods and in mixed methods. She is fundamentally interested in how we approach ways of understanding the social world, and how best to collect and analyze data that helps us untangle and address issues of substantive, conceptual, theoretical, and empirical interest.</p>\n<h3>Registration fees</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>UNC-CH Students: $0, with a $35 deposit to hold your spot (deposit is refundable upon your attendance)</li>\n<li>UNC-CH Faculty/Staff/Postdoc: $95</li>\n<li>Non-UNC-CH: $145</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://apps.research.unc.edu/events/index.cfm?event=events.eventDetails&amp;event_key=67A7F2810222C3B84040A189798845B71CCEA861\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Register for Introduction to Mixed Methods Here</a></h2>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>This class will be offered via Zoom ONLY.

    "description": "<p>This course will be offered via ZOOM only. However, this course will not be recorded.</p>\n<p>Although graduate school teaches you many things, many Ph.D. students complete their dissertations having never been fully trained in academic publishing. How does academic publishing actually work? Where should you publish your research? How do you actually get papers accepted in strong academic journals? In this talk, we will discuss several major ideas in academic publishing (focusing on the social sciences). We will discuss:<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&#8211; professional integrity and ethics<br />\n&#8211; the role of academic conversations and communities as a guide for publication forums and journal selections<br />\n&#8211; the mechanics of publishing in journals and other forums (including outlining, writing style, journal, legal, and newspaper submissions, the peer review process, revisions, and corresponding with editors)<br />\n&#8211; and acceptance and all that follows.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Course schedule for the day:</h3>\n<p>9am &#8211; 10:15am<br />\nBreak<br />\n10:30am &#8211; 11:45am<br />\nLunch<br />\n12:45pm &#8211; 2pm<br />\nBreak<br />\n2:15pm &#8211; 4:00pm<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Instructor Bio:</h3>\n<p>Todd BenDor is a Professor of City and Regional Planning at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Nesting can arise from hierarchical data structures (e.g., siblings nested within family; patients nested within therapist), longitudinal data structures (repeated measures nested within individual), or both (repeated measures nested within patient and patient nested within therapist). It is well known that the analysis of nested data structures using traditional general linear models (e.g., ANOVA or regression) is flawed, oftentimes substantially so: Tests of significance are likely biased and within- and between-group effects are confounded with one another.
